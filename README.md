# Workplace-Jarvis-Meeting-Task-Assistant
Workplace “Jarvis” – Meeting & Task Assistant is an end-to-end NLP system designed to automatically process multi-party meeting transcripts and generate structured meeting summaries, decisions, and actionable tasks. Using the AMI and ICSI Meeting Corpora along with our custom annotated dataset, the project combines extractive and abstractive summarization, heuristic and transformer-based classification, and a spaCy-powered NER pipeline to identify tasks, responsible persons, and deadlines. The repository includes the full NLP_final_project notebook, which integrates data ingestion, preprocessing, summarization (TextRank, BART zero-shot, and fine-tuned BART), action-item extraction, evaluation (ROUGE, BERTScore, PR/ROC curves), human-evaluation results, and JSON-based structured outputs. This repo also contains the custom manual annotation files used for evaluation, making the system fully reproducible and easy to extend for future development.
