Bmr027,Bmr027_570,"my , i was thinking that with the nsa meetings , i 'd like there are three of them , and they 're , i will have them done by monday .",ICSI,action_item
ES2013c,ES2013c_276,and we should each have a presentation to make .,AMI,action_item
IS1001d,IS1001d_130,then i've i will also take notes during this meeting and i will send you a summary then as usual .,AMI,action_item
TS3011c,TS3011c_385,", it's it's when we come back in thirty minutes , you will have a prototype ready .",AMI,action_item
EN2001d,EN2001d_427,we should certainly take away the labels that say minus four times as well .,AMI,action_item
ES2002d,ES2002d_620,", i mean if you , i mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way i see this i is that it's the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the tasks were d sort of divided , and then the work went on in isolation i don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different , but , but but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said , first thing we have to do is come up with let's say a design concept , and we sit here together and do it , well that's what teamwork is .",AMI,action_item
Bmr021,Bmr021_424,"i will by next week , though .",ICSI,action_item
IS1009b,IS1009b_206,"so i'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you , and i'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know , what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle .",AMI,action_item
IS1000a,IS1000a_33,you all get certain task in this in this phase and then we will meet again and discuss this functional design .,AMI,action_item
IS1004b,IS1004b_344,next meeting here are the task you have to work on .,AMI,action_item
Bed006,Bed006_500,"and then , secondly , we had , you may remember , the problem with the re - phrasing , that subject always re - phrase sort of the task that we gave them , and so we had a meeting on friday talking about how to avoid that , and it proved finally fruitful in the sense that we came up with a new scenario for how to get the subject m to really have intentions and sort of to act upon those , and there the idea is now that next actually we need to hire one more person to actually do that job because it 's getting more complicated .",ICSI,action_item
Bed011,Bed011_129,"and one just s sort of has to watch which also final decision node so it doesn't make sense t to figure out whether he wants to enter , view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place .",ICSI,action_item
Bmr002,Bmr002_903,"i 'm gonna go download "" transcriber "" and jane and i will look at it well i think the answer is we need to record as many as we can .",ICSI,action_item
IN1005,IN1005_468,but i think for any kind of way you have to select those alpha you have to look at the effect on the re on the t evaluation task .,AMI,action_item
EN2002d,EN2002d_644,well i will well i will i will need your snippets of code or it'd be good if i had them by tomorrow evening .,AMI,action_item
ES2010c,ES2010c_229,"we have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available .",AMI,action_item
IN1012,IN1012_265,"at the end then they will ask you to synthesise some sentence and you have to synthesise them and then you have to send them your training data , onl no development , training , no , training evaluate it's again subject to s because for speech synthes .",AMI,action_item
EN2003a,EN2003a_328,"but i think what we should say is when i put out this call , i'll put both deadlines , and i think i'll say that when you send in your abstract , you need to mention that any technology you intend to use , so that at least if we have all the information ?",AMI,action_item
ES2002d,ES2002d_205,"and the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .",AMI,action_item
IS1001c,IS1001c_58,"we'll then t take decision in concert and then we will define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .",AMI,agenda_item
ES2014b,ES2014b_86,but we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next meeting each person that's got a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .,AMI,agenda_item
ES2013c,ES2013c_279,"there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after i take us to the minutes of the previous meeting .",AMI,agenda_item
EN2002b,EN2002b_448,we could probably i know if we'll have time to look at that before tomorrow .,AMI,agenda_item
IS1001b,IS1001b_147,then we will take the decision on the remote control needed functions and then i will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting .,AMI,agenda_item
IB4004,IB4004_261,i hope it won't be too long and especially that we'll make some progress on this on this small task that is putting people in our new rooms .,AMI,agenda_item
Bro003,Bro003_106,"this is what i have for an agenda so far , we should talk a little bit about the plans for the the field trip next week .",ICSI,agenda_item
ES2006a,ES2006a_4,"anyway , this is the plan for today's meeting is firstly just to introduce the project briefly , although i'm sure you've actually got some of the information already .",AMI,agenda_item
Bmr027,Bmr027_162,"well we haven't really started , but i thought we more we more or less did meeting recorder stuff last week , so i thought we could do , but i figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each .",ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr025,Bmr025_321,does anyone have anything to add to the agenda ?,ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr026,Bmr026_106,a all i 'm saying is that on so what i meant was on the me this meeting if i wa something i 'm making a major thing in the agenda is i wanna help in getting together a list of what it is that we 've done so i can tell her .,ICSI,agenda_item
Btr001,Btr001_457,so i 'll i guess i 'll keep the agenda .,ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr026,Bmr026_620,", that 's another agenda item .",ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr026,Bmr026_652,just record the audio clip and show an image and i think that 's and the last i item on the agenda is disk issues yet again .,ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr031,Bmr031_580,"so , i was just thinking maybe just go around and just brief briefly look what 's other things that are going on , maybe , since we don't don't have much of a set a set agenda and we don't have much time .",ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr027,Bmr027_141,"i mean , the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , the automatic alignments because , , i got some i learned from thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech or , of the foreground speech with background speech .",ICSI,agenda_item
ES2003a,ES2003a_36,this is the agenda for today's meeting .,AMI,agenda_item
ES2004a,ES2004a_119,", this is our agenda , we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other .",AMI,agenda_item
Bro016,Bro016_188,"so other than reading digits , what 's our agenda ?",ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr027,Bmr027_159,ugh ! so i didn't send out agenda items because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item and now we have two .,ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr024,Bmr024_300,", another , thing on the agenda said sri recognition experiments ?",ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr023,Bmr023_569,do we have an agenda ?,ICSI,agenda_item
ES2004d,ES2004d_562,"i think the agenda one was where the price was , wasn't it ?",AMI,agenda_item
ES2004b,ES2004b_209,", our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?",AMI,agenda_item
Bmr024,Bmr024_219,"so there was some in adam 's agenda list , he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition ?",ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr027,Bmr027_946,so what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ?,ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr024,Bmr024_151,", i think we want to start off with the agenda .",ICSI,agenda_item
ES2010c,ES2010c_5,"'kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting .",AMI,agenda_item
ES2005c,ES2005c_369,", i don't know if y it just ca it just came up on my on my agenda .",AMI,agenda_item
Bmr031,Bmr031_433,"so , , you didn't you didn't get an agenda , i guess .",ICSI,agenda_item
EN2001a,EN2001a_392,", i think today's meeting is really the one where we where we sort of settle down the data structure and as soon as we have that , probably like after today's meeting , we then actually need to well go back first of all and look at nite x_m_l_ to see in how far that which we want is compatible with that which nite x_m_l_ offers us .",AMI,agenda_item
Bmr024,Bmr024_791,so why don't we have that on the agenda and we 'll we 'll get to it and talk about it ?,ICSI,agenda_item
Bro019,Bro019_555,do we have anything like an agenda ?,ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr024,Bmr024_799,"i mean , i think , chuck was the one who added out the agenda item .",ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr026,Bmr026_588,"so , i think this is gonna be a pretty short meeting because i have four agenda items , three of them were requested by jane who is not gonna be at the meeting today .",ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr024,Bmr024_221,another one that we had on adam 's agenda that definitely involved you was s something about smartkom ?,ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr024,Bmr024_787,"and , somewhere is my agenda .",ICSI,agenda_item
Bmr030,Bmr030_444,that 's wha - what did i have on the agenda i mailed out ?,ICSI,agenda_item
EN2001a,EN2001a_51,well i guess the important thing is to get the crucial m modules built .,AMI,agenda_item
TS3010b,TS3010b_291,"so and after that we have to make decisions , what we will do .",AMI,agenda_item
TS3012c,TS3012c_21,so we have to decide on that in a minute .,AMI,agenda_item
ES2014b,ES2014b_86,but we have to make the decisions on the remote control functions and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next meeting each person that's got a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is .,AMI,decision_item
TS3011b,TS3011b_97,"well , for we do have to decide this meeting .",AMI,decision_item
TS3012c,TS3012c_63,i think we have to decide on this anyway .,AMI,decision_item
TS3012c,TS3012c_21,so we have to decide on that in a minute .,AMI,decision_item
ES2016d,ES2016d_205,"or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation .",AMI,decision_item
ES2015c,ES2015c_271,", there are several components of , , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of .",AMI,decision_item
IB4011,IB4011_651,", i'll try to do something , but first anyway we have to select a movie .",AMI,decision_item
TS3012c,TS3012c_514,"so then we'll just have to d have to go on , you know , the information that we have to make the make final decisions on on a conceptual design .",AMI,decision_item
IS1008b,IS1008b_122,"no , i haven't really i wanted feedback , i think we need to rate rank these , but we'll see what your personal preferences are and your thoughts .",AMI,decision_item
TS3010a,TS3010a_74,so now we have to think about what we will make .,AMI,decision_item
TS3011b,TS3011b_68,", m maybe w we we do agree on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011b,TS3011b_117,i agree actually .,AMI,decision_item
TS3012c,TS3012c_148,i can quickly make a conclusion of what we have decided so far .,AMI,decision_item
TS3011d,TS3011d_109,"yes , i agree too .",AMI,decision_item
TS3012b,TS3012b_93,because we decided that it's n not that important .,AMI,decision_item
TS3009d,TS3009d_186,", i agree .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011d,TS3011d_473,d do you agree ?,AMI,decision_item
ES2012c,ES2012c_11,"so again , i'll we'll have the three presentations from the three of you and then we'll we'll make a final a final decision .",AMI,decision_item
IB4004,IB4004_566,"to discuss and compare with the other proposal and , well , make a final decision .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011c,TS3011c_366,", i agree .",AMI,decision_item
TS3012c,TS3012c_207,"it has no function , i agree .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011d,TS3011d_416,", i agree .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011d,TS3011d_176,"yes , i agree .",AMI,decision_item
IB4004,IB4004_408,"but the problem is it has been decided by everyone and approved by the school that we need the lounge , so i think it's simply not no actually , i'm sorry , it's .",AMI,decision_item
TS3012c,TS3012c_208,i agree .,AMI,decision_item
TS3012c,TS3012c_123,", i agree .",AMI,decision_item
TS3009d,TS3009d_184,", i agree .",AMI,decision_item
IB4004,IB4004_282,"it's more a matter of how to arrange the furniture , but since we are experts at this task , so maybe we could count on four places , but the final decision is not really ours , so we'll see actually this exactly .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011b,TS3011b_168,i think that's what we decided .,AMI,decision_item
TS3011d,TS3011d_43,i agree .,AMI,decision_item
TS3012c,TS3012c_25,i suggest that we decide on that one immediately .,AMI,decision_item
TS3011b,TS3011b_164,"and well , i it should be easy , that's w what we concluded .",AMI,decision_item
TS3012c,TS3012c_125,", i agree .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011c,TS3011c_371,"so on the energy , well , we decided .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011d,TS3011d_495,"you agree , .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011d,TS3011d_31,", i agree .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011b,TS3011b_121,"so i'm i'm i do not agree exactly , exactly .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011d,TS3011d_517,", you can't really decide .",AMI,decision_item
TS3012a,TS3012a_179,i agree .,AMI,decision_item
TS3011d,TS3011d_107,"it would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar .",AMI,decision_item
TS3011c,TS3011c_409,"yes , the voice recognition we already decided .",AMI,decision_item
EN2001a,EN2001a_31,", i think that's the one .",AMI,decision_item
Buw001,Buw001_1266,"just want to be sure there 's enough data to , good .",ICSI,decision_item
EN2001a,EN2001a_46,i don't think anyone's been allocated to do that yet .,AMI,decision_item
TS3005c,TS3005c_597,"but do we have to we'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we .",AMI,other_item
IS1004b,IS1004b_54,so well we w well we will have a bit of a simpler task in that we're only doing a television remote control .,AMI,other_item
Bro007,Bro007_290,well you guys doing great stuff so that 's that 's really neat and we 'll g don't think we need to well the other thing i guess that i will say is that the digits that we 're gonna record momentarily is starting to get are starting to get into a pretty good size collection and in addition to the speechdat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now so that 's that 's another source of data .,ICSI,other_item
TS3004b,TS3004b_552,"you'll also have to use a mute button to maybe , not i don't know where you have to put it .",AMI,other_item
IN1005,IN1005_20,", well but , well , but i mean if you have to judge it's with respect to a given task , i mean you can't say of course it's always good , because it's maximising the likelihood of whatever .",AMI,other_item
EN2002b,EN2002b_514,"and so there are ways around it , but you know , whether i'll be able to figure something out like that till before tomorrow , i know .",AMI,other_item
Bmr028,Bmr028_265,"so i so it 's it 's a good wake - up call if people "" well , we have this performance but you have to keep in mind , we 're doing we 're we 're not doing the whole real task in this way and this way and this way .",ICSI,other_item
Bmr013,Bmr013_545,"no they don't have this you have to enter the data before , you do the second task , but they don't have to happen at the same time .",ICSI,other_item
ES2014b,ES2014b_87,we'll also know w when the next meeting is i so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task .,AMI,other_item
IN1002,IN1002_474,", so but we don't know , like we thought like i thought it's recovering , so maybe by tomorrow i'll get everything , so .",AMI,other_item
Buw001,Buw001_1019,"but they won't exist anywhere in the a you know it but it may well , probably if you have to sit there at the end of a meeting and say one thing you remember , it 's probably whatever action item was assigned to you .",ICSI,other_item
Bed004,Bed004_388,"we could talk to the people who run it and see if they have a way that they could easily tell people that there 's a task , pays ten bucks or something , but you have to be comfortable reading relatively complicated stuff .",ICSI,other_item
Bed011,Bed011_84,then they will read a task where lots of german words are sort of thrown in between .,ICSI,other_item
EN2009b,EN2009b_459,i don't know what real purpose of these little folded up a_ four fliers .,AMI,other_item
ES2002d,ES2002d_603,in reality i think here the different elements of leadership such as the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within .,AMI,other_item
EN2001a,EN2001a_329,"then when whatever your algorithm is doing , as long as when you're working with utterances , you go for all the leaves , like then if you need something next up , so like a topic segment , you'd go to here .",AMI,other_item
ES2002b,ES2002b_65,"it's fairly general , and i guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in the way you're thinking , like voice recognition , , , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power .",AMI,other_item
Btr002,Btr002_1390,"the one that i 'm thinking of , i it 's a matter of you can tell it 's in context where he 's looking in his agenda to see , you know , "" do i have time to do this ?",ICSI,other_item
Bmr024,Bmr024_228,"s so , what is the purpose of this recording ?",ICSI,other_item
ES2002a,ES2002a_227,"they're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , m_p_ three players , telephones , everything , agenda .",AMI,other_item

IB4003,IB4003_423,"but that's that's really an open discussion and that d i think no decision , no final decision has been taken about that .",AMI,other_item
TS3011b,TS3011b_98,we need to have the the user function the functions decided and our target audience .,AMI,other_item
EN2001a,EN2001a_38,and the list of them that occurred .,AMI,other_item
Buw001,Buw001_1292,"so "" found data "" , they mean like established corpora of linguistics and other fields , ?",ICSI,other_item
EN2001a,EN2001a_27,"ye that's the impression i get , .",AMI,other_item
EN2001a,EN2001a_55,", i think so .",AMI,other_item

Buw001.,Buw001._0,i especially liked the part where we were asked what questions were interesting .,ICSI,other_item

EN2001a,EN2001a_40,so that's where that's stored .,AMI,other_item
Buw001,Buw001_1294,but it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and other fields .,ICSI,other_item
Buw001,Buw001_1281,so it is possible to lessen if we wanted to .,ICSI,other_item

Buw001,Buw001_1287,", i think that 's always desired .",ICSI,other_item
